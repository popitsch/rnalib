    "The increasing abundance and complexity of biological data often requires programatic approaches for their analysis that allow for the rapid development of custom yet efficient, well-tested and reproducible analysis pipelines. \n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional approaches (e.g., bash command/perl pipelines), that suffer from low readability, maintainability and reproducibility,\n",
    "are increasingly superseded by complex, containerized (e.g., Singularity) analysis pipelines that combine specialized bioinformatics tools \n",

    "Despite not being the fastest option, *Python* is a [popular choice by analysts](https://github.blog/2023-03-02-why-python-keeps-growing-explained/), mainly due to the large number of available (bioinformatics) libraries, its simple and well-documented syntax and its broad utility in the emerging data science field.\n",

    "- In [bioframe](https://bioframe.readthedocs.io/), which is based on pandas dataframes, you could:\n",
    "    - first use [overlap()](https://bioframe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide-intervalops.html#overlap) to intersect the interval sets\n",
    "    - then group on the annotated feature location using pandas [groupby](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html) method\n",
    "    - and finally apply some [user defined mutate methods](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/gotchas.html#gotchas-udf-mutation) via apply() or aggregate().\n",
    "\n",
    "`pygenlib` contains an `AnnotationIterator` for annotating genomic intervals with data from one or *multiple* other genomic location iterators.\n",
    "This iterator synchronizes genomic locations of the primary iterator (iterating the intervals to be annotated) with all annotating iterators and yields respective locations and data for all overlapping intervals. In the example below, we iterate over annotations in a genomic subregion of a flybase GTF file and annotate all features with  (i) a list of SNPs that were called in 3 particular samples of a multi-sample VCF file and (ii) values from bedgraph file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** that iterating over large interval sets is generally considered slow and is often not needed. \n",
    "In many cases you can use list [comprehension, vectorisation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16476924/how-to-iterate-over-rows-in-a-pandas-dataframe/)\n",
    "or mechanisms such as [pandas apply()](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.apply.html) or [pybedtools each()](https://daler.github.io/pybedtools/each.html) as described above. \n",
    "Nevertheless, there are scenarios in which we consider AnnotationIterators  useful, e.g., if you need to access to contextual data (e.g., annotation results from previous data rows) or if you need (fine-grained) access to multiple synchronized datasets in parallel. Performance drawbacks of iteration approaches are also diminished when integrating multiple iterators in parallel. The overall goal of AnnotationIterators is to improve code readability and reduce potential error sources such as [the ones discussed in the 'RelatedWork' notebook](RelatedWork_performance.ipynb#Potential-pifalls). AnnotationIterators are also used by pygenlib's [`transcriptome.annotate()`](#Annotation-of-features) method for incremental transcriptome annotation as shown below."

    "## Transcriptome implementation\n",
    "_Pygenlib_ provides a `transcriptome` implementation that enables convenient access/filtering of genomic annotations via python. \n",
    "Briefly, a (filtered) input GTF/GFF file is parsed and respective (frozen) dataclasses that derive from the generic `Feature` class are instantiated. \n",
    "The implementation keeps track of parent/child relationships (e.g., between genes, transcripts and their exons) and enables efficient iteration/querying and annotation of genomic annotations. Data fields and annotations can conveniently be accessed via 'dot' notation (i.e., `<feature>.<attribute>`). \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the current implementation does not implement the full GFF3 format as specified [here](https://github.com/The-Sequence-Ontology/Specifications/blob/master/gff3.md)\n",
    "but currently rather supports various popular gff 'flavours' as published by encode, ensembl, ucsc, chess, mirgenedb and flybase.\n",
    "It also supports a 'generic' GFF3 format where all parsed features are interpreted as 'transcript' objects irrespecting the actual feature_type column.\n",
    "Respective parent 'gene' annotations are automatically added, no sub-features (exons, introns, etc.) are created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a brief description of the datamodel depicted below:\n",
    "-   Model contains `genes`, `transcripts` and arbitrary sub-features (e.g., `exons`, `introns`, 3'/5'-`UTR`s, `CDS`) as defined\n",
    "    in the GFF file. Note that `intron` annotations are calculated automatically from exon annotations unless configured otherwise. \n",
    "    Frozen dataclasses (derived from the 'Feature' class) are created for all parsed feature types automatically and users may configure which \n",
    "    GTF/GFF attributes will be parsed and added to those dataclasses as fields.\n",
    "    Gene intervals must envelop transcript intervals which must envelop sub-feature intervals.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   A transcriptome maintains an `anno` dict that maps (frozen) features to dicts of arbitrary annotation values which supports the (incremental) annotation of annotation features. Annotation values can be accessed like GFF-parsed fields via 'dot' notation: `<feature>.<attribute>`. \n",
    "    \n",
    "-   The implementation exploits the hierarchical relationship between genes and their sub-features to optimize storage and computational requirements where possible.        \n",
    "    Genomic sequences, for example, can be loaded from a reference genome via load_sequence_datas() but will only be directly stored in strings attached to gene feature.\n",
    "    Sequences can then be accessed via transcriptome.get_sequence(). For sub-features (e.g., transcripts, exons, etc.) the respective sequence will be sliced from the \n",
    "    gene sequence on demand.  Note that despite being computed on demand, genomic sequences can still be accessed via `<feature>.sequence` which will call \n",
    "    transcriptome.get_sequence() with default parameters.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   The get_sequence() method supports several modes:\n",
    "    If `mode='rna'` is passed, the sequence is returned in 5'-3' orientation, i.e., they are reverse-complemented\n",
    "    for minus-strand transcripts. The returned sequence will, however, still use the DNA alphabet (ACTG) to\n",
    "    enable direct alignment/comparison with genomic sequences.\n",
    "    if `mode='spliced'`, the spliced 5'-3' sequence will be returned.\n",
    "    if `mode='translated'`, the spliced 5'-3' CDS sequence will be returned.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   Genomic range queries via query() are supported by a combination of interval and linear search queries.\n",
    "    A transcriptome object maintains one intervaltree per chromosome built from gene annotations.\n",
    "    Overlap/envelop queries will first be applied to the respective intervaltree and the (typically small\n",
    "    result sets) will then be filtered, e.g., for requested sub-feature types.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   Transcriptome models can also be built from subsets of GFF/GTF files by filtering contained transcripts with a TranscriptFilter() that can restrict, e.g., included chromosomes, genomic regions, transcript_ids, gene_types or transcripts with certain 'tag' values (as used in gencode).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   A transcriptome object keeps track of the numbers of filtered GFF entries in a `log` Counter object that is, e.g., useful for debugging. The 'structure' of the parsed features can be accessed via the `get_struct()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following cells demonstrate some use cases."

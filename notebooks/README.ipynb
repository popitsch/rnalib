    "### AnnotationIterator\n",
    "\n",
    "Data integration is a central use case for genomic libraries which often requires the annotation of genomic intervals with data derived from other, overlapping genomic intervals. One example is to calculate a score baed on data associated with all overlapping intervals from one or multiple other dataset(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different approaches to achieve these tasks:\n",

    "    - apply a custom annotation method via [map()](https://daler.github.io/pybedtools/autodocs/pybedtools.bedtool.BedTool.map.html#pybedtools.bedtool.BedTool.map) or [each()](https://daler.github.io/pybedtools/autodocs/pybedtools.bedtool.BedTool.each.html#pybedtools.bedtool.BedTool.each) method\n",
    "- In [bioframe](https://bioframe.readthedocs.io/), which is based on pandas dataframes, you could:\n",

    "`pygenlib` contains an `AnnotationIterator` for annotating genomic intervals with data from one or *multiple* other genomic location iterators.\n",
    "This iterator synchronizes genomic locations of the primary iterator (iterating the intervals to be annotated) with all annotating iterators and yields respective locations and data for all overlapping intervals. In the example below, we iterate over annotations in a genomic subregion of a flybase GTF file and annotate all features with  (i) a list of SNPs that were called in 3 particular samples of a multi-sample VCF file and (ii) values from bedgraph file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** that iterating over large interval sets is generally considered slow and is often not needed. \n",
    "In many cases you can use list [comprehension, vectorisation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16476924/how-to-iterate-over-rows-in-a-pandas-dataframe/)\n",
    "or mechanisms such as [pandas apply()](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.apply.html) or [pybedtools each()](https://daler.github.io/pybedtools/each.html) as described above. \n",
    "Nevertheless, there are scenarios in which we consider AnnotationIterators  useful, e.g., if you need to access to contextual data (e.g., annotation results from previous data rows) or if you need (fine-grained) access to multiple synchronized datasets in parallel. Performance drawbacks of iteration approaches are also diminished when integrating multiple iterators in parallel. The overall goal of AnnotationIterators is to improve code readability and reduce potential error sources such as [the ones discussed below](#Potential-pifalls). AnnotationIterators are also used by pygenlib's [`transcriptome.annotate()`](#Annotation-of-features) method for incremental transcriptome annotation as shown below."

    "## Transcriptome implementation\n",
    "_Pygenlib_ provides a `transcriptome` implementation that enables convenient access/filtering of genomic annotations via python. \n",
    "Briefly, a (filtered) input GTF/GFF file is parsed and respective (frozen) dataclasses that derive from the generic `Feature` class are instantiated. \n",
    "The implementation keeps track of parent/child relationships (e.g., between genes, transcripts and their exons) and enables efficient iteration/querying and annotation of genomic annotations. Data fields and annotations can conveniently be accessed via 'dot' notation (i.e., `<feature>.<attribute>`). \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the current implementation does not implement the full GFF3 format as specified [here](https://github.com/The-Sequence-Ontology/Specifications/blob/master/gff3.md)\n",
    "but currently rather supports various popular gff 'flavours' as published by encode, ensembl, ucsc, chess, mirgenedb and flybase.\n",
    "It also supports a 'generic' GFF3 format where all parsed features are interpreted as 'transcript' objects irrespecting the actual feature_type column.\n",
    "Respective parent 'gene' annotations are automatically added, no sub-features (exons, introns, etc.) are created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a brief description of the datamodel depicted below:\n",
    "-   Model contains `genes`, `transcripts` and arbitrary sub-features (e.g., `exons`, `introns`, 3'/5'-`UTR`s, `CDS`) as defined\n",
    "    in the GFF file. Note that `intron` annotations are calculated automatically from exon annotations unless configured otherwise. \n",
    "    Frozen dataclasses (derived from the 'Feature' class) are created for all parsed feature types automatically and users may configure which \n",
    "    GTF/GFF attributes will be parsed and added to those dataclasses as fields.\n",
    "    Gene intervals must envelop transcript intervals which must envelop sub-feature intervals.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   A transcriptome maintains an `anno` dict that maps (frozen) features to dicts of arbitrary annotation values which supports the (incremental) annotation of annotation features. Annotation values can be accessed like GFF-parsed fields via 'dot' notation: `<feature>.<attribute>`. \n",
    "    \n",
    "-   The implementation exploits the hierarchical relationship between genes and their sub-features to optimize storage and computational requirements where possible.        \n",
    "    Genomic sequences, for example, can be loaded from a reference genome via load_sequences() but will only be directly stored in strings attached to gene feature.\n",
    "    Sequences can then be accessed via transcriptome.get_sequence(). For sub-features (e.g., transcripts, exons, etc.) the respective sequence will be sliced from the \n",
    "    gene sequence on demand.  Note that despite being computed on demand, genomic sequences can still be accessed via `<feature>.sequence` which will call \n",
    "    transcriptome.get_sequence() with default parameters.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   The get_sequence() method supports several modes:\n",
    "    If `mode='rna'` is passed, the sequence is returned in 5'-3' orientation, i.e., they are reverse-complemented\n",
    "    for minus-strand transcripts. The returned sequence will, however, still use the DNA alphabet (ACTG) to\n",
    "    enable direct alignment/comparison with genomic sequences.\n",
    "    if `mode='spliced'`, the spliced 5'-3' sequence will be returned.\n",
    "    if `mode='translated'`, the spliced 5'-3' CDS sequence will be returned.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   Genomic range queries via query() are supported by a combination of interval and linear search queries.\n",
    "    A transcriptome object maintains one intervaltree per chromosome built from gene annotations.\n",
    "    Overlap/envelop queries will first be applied to the respective intervaltree and the (typically small\n",
    "    result sets) will then be filtered, e.g., for requested sub-feature types.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   Transcriptome models can also be built from subsets of GFF/GTF files by filtering contained transcripts with a TranscriptFilter() that can restrict included chromosomes, genomic regions, transcript_ids, gene_types or transcripts with certain 'tag' values (as used in gencode).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The transcriptome build process is configured by a single JSON file/dict as shown below. The transcriptome object keeps track of the numbers of filtered GFF entries in a `log` Counter object that is, e.g., useful for debugging. The 'structure' of the parsed features can be accessed via the `get_struct()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following cells demonstrate some use cases."

In this regard, their functionality overlaps partially with pygenlib's genomic iterators that are mainly built on the [pysam](https://pysam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "While using these libraries on large datasets is often considerably faster than the corresponding 'native' pygenlib iterators, it is also a bit 'unsafer' to use them as [demonstrated below](#) as ...\n",
    "\n",
    "After highlighting such potential pitfalls, we show some [performance comparisons](#Performance-comparison) for various scenarios and show that speed benefits are often anulled when considering only subsets of large datasets (such as features of certain types on certain chromosomes) as the compared libraries either load the whole dataset before filtering can be applied (e.g., bioframe) or need to apply relatively costly preprocessing operations (such as pybedtools intersect) that are efficiently solved by pygenlib's pysam-based iterators that leverage the respective indexing structures for this purpose.\n",

    "Overall, however, we envision that user's would like to mix and match these APIs for maximum overall benefit. Users could, for example, first use pybedtools or bioframe operations on some input file and then run custom pygenlib transcriptomics analyses on them.

    "### Filtered iteration\n",
    "Here we add some more filtering steps and compare different methods for counting minus strand features on one chromosome in a large GFF3 file that is downloaded from gencode to a temporary directory, sorted, bgzipped, index and then analysed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- for pybedtools, we either intersect the file or apply a filter method, then parse the respective fields and count\n",
    "- for bioframe, we init a filtered DataFrame via our BioframeIterator implementation, filter for the proper strand using pandas and then iterate+count\n",
    "- we use a chromosome-filtered pygenlib GFF3Iterator for comparison, filter by interval strand and count the returned feature_type \n",
    "\n",
    "The pybedtools_filter option is slowest as it needs to iterate the whole dataset when filtering.\n",
    "The pybedtools_intersect option is much faster but also dominated by the intersect (chrom filtering) operation.\n",
    "The shown pandas/bioframe approach is also relatively slow as it also needs to read the whole dataframe before filtering in two steps for the targeted genomic region and strand. \n",
    "Finally, the pygenlib GFF3Iterator (based on pysam) is the fastest option in this benchmark, probably due to the fast chromosome filtering based on the leveraged tabix index.\n"

    "### PyBedtools comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "[Pybedtools](https://daler.github.io/pybedtools/index.html) is a python library wrapping the popular BEDTools utilities. It enables various set theory operations on genomic dataset (such as intersect, merge, count, complement, and shuffle) in various data formats (BAM, BED, GFF/GTF and VCF) and also supports data streaming. In this regard, its functionality overlaps partially with pygenlib's genomic iterators that are mainly built on the pysam implementation. \n",
    "\n",
    "While pybedtools is considerably faster than the corresponding 'native' pygenlib iterators, it is also a bit 'unsafer' to use them as demonstrated below. Overall, however, we envision that user's would like to mix and match pybedtools and pygenlib based on the actual use-case and performance requirements. Users could, for example, use BEDtools set operations on some input file, store these files and then run a pygenlib analysis on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate seamless workflows that integrate both libraries, we also implemented a `PybedtoolsIterator` that wraps a pybedtools BedTool while providing the same interface (e.g., region filtering, stats  output) as other pygenlib iterators. Below we compare the performance of pygenlib and pybedtools iterators on various tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Iteration\n",
    "Here we compare iteration performance between a native `pybedtools` and a `pygenlib` bed iterator. On our test system, pybedtools was ~40-60% faster."

    "### Pybedtools unsorted input example\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we demonstrate how unsorted input may lead to wrong analysis results using pybedtools.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code block was copy-pasted from the [pybedtools page](https://github.com/daler/pybedtools) and the idea of this example is to create a list of gene names that are <5 kb away from intergenic SNPs. However, this code does not work properly (with pybedtools v0.9.1) due to inconsistent chromosome order of the two input files (hg19.gff: chr1, chr21; snps.bed.gz: chr21, chr1; both are pybedtools test resources).\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, genes.closest reports only -1 as distance which is why all closes genes will be reported, not just the ones at max 5kb distance.\n",
    "Notably, the code runs without errors/warnings and returns a reasonable-sized list of gene names which makes it hard to spot the error. \n",
    "Only when omitting the `stream=True` flag, genes.closest() fails and reports the inconsistent chrom order. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note, that in *pygenlib*, input files have to be bgzipped and indexed which requires them to be coordinate sorted and that reference dictionaries are used to ensure consistent chromosome ordering."

    "### Mutable interval pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "Another, more subtle, pitfall results from how genomic intervals and their annotations are implemented in the different python libraries.\n",
    "In most cases, intervals are implemented as [mutable](https://realpython.com/python-mutable-vs-immutable-types/) objects whose values can be changed at runtime.\n",
    "Often these interval objects also contain associated (mutable) meta-data (such as interval names, scores, etc.). \n",
    "This, however, means that updates of intervals or associated meta-data results in changed hash values of the respective objects as shown below.\n",
    "This makes them unsafe to use as keys in referencing datastructures such as dicts and can lead to unwanted side-effects. \n",
    "\n",
    "In *pygenlib*, [genomic intervals](#Genomic-intervals) (locations) and their annotations are modeled separatedly with the former being implemented as [frozen (basically immutable) dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html#frozen-instances) while the latter being stored in a dict-like datastructure that is indexed by the respective interval. \n",

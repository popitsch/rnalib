Splitting a reference dict (i.e., a genome representation) into such blocks can easily be done using its `iter_blocks()` method. Iterating over a large BAM file, handling non-overlapping genomic intervals, for example, can be done as follow:"

    "## Transcriptome implementation\n",
    "_Pygenlib_ provides a transcriptome implementation that enables convenient access/filtering of genomic annotations via python. \n",
    "Briefly,a (filtered) input GTF/GFF file is parsed and respective (frozen) dataclasses that derive from the generic Feature class are instantiated. \n",
    "The implementation keeps track of parent/child relationships (e.g., between genes, transcripts and their exons) and enables efficient iteration/querying and annotation of genomic annotations. Data fields and annotations can conveniently be accessed by `<feature>.<attribute>`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the current implementation does not implement the full GFF3 format as specified [here](https://github.com/The-Sequence-Ontology/Specifications/blob/master/gff3.md)\n",
    "but currently rather supports various popular gff 'flavours' as published by encode, ensembl, ucsc, mirgenedb and flybase.\n",
    "It also supports a 'generic' GFF3 format where all parsed features are interpreted as 'transcript' objects irrespecting the actual feature_type column.\n",
    "Respective parent 'gene' annotations are automatically added, no sub-features (exons, introns, etc.) are created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a brief description of the datamodel depicted below:\n",
    "-   Model contains genes, transcripts and arbitrary sub-features (e.g., exons, intron, 3'/5'-UTRs, CDS) as defined\n",
    "    in the GFF file. Note that intron annotations are calculated automatically from exon annotations unless configured otherwise. \n",
    "    Frozen dataclasses (derived from the 'Feature' class) are created for all parsed feature\n",
    "    types automatically and users may configure which GTF/GFF attributes will be parsed and added to those dataclasses as fields.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   A transcriptome maintains an `anno` dict that maps (frozen) features to dicts of arbitrary annotation values which supports the (incremental) annotation of annotation features. Annotation values can be accessed like GFF-parsed fields via 'dot' notation: `<feature>.<attribute>`. \n",
    "    \n",
    "-   The implementation exploits the hierarchical relationship between genes and their sub-features to optimize storage and computational requirements where posssible.        \n",
    "    Genomic sequences, for example, can be loaded from a reference genome via load_sequences() but will only be directly stored in strings attached to gene feature.\n",
    "    Sequences can then be accessed via transcriptome.get_sequence(). For sub-features (e.g., transcripts, exons, etc.) the respective sequence will be sliced from the \n",
    "    gene sequence on demand.  Note that despite being computed on demand, genomic sequences can still be accessed via `<feature>.sequence` which will call \n",
    "    transcriptome.get_sequence() with default parameters.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   The get_sequence() method supports several modes:\n",
    "    If `mode='rna'` is passed, the sequence is returned in 5'-3' orientation, i.e., they are reverse-complemented\n",
    "    for minus-strand transcripts. The returned sequence will, however, still use the DNA alphabet (ACTG) to\n",
    "    enable direct alignment/comparison with genomic sequences.\n",
    "    if `mode='spliced'`, the spliced 5'-3' sequence will be returned.\n",
    "    if `mode='translated'`, the spliced 5'-3' CDS sequence will be returned.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   Genomic range queries via query() are supported by a combination of interval and linear search queries.\n",
    "    A transcriptome object maintains one intervaltree per chromosome built from gene annotations.\n",
    "    Overlap/envelop queries will first be applied to the respective intervaltree and the (typically small\n",
    "    result sets) will then be filtered, e.g., for requested sub-feature types.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   Transcriptome models can also be built from subsets of GFF/GTF files by filtering contained transcripts with a TranscriptFilter() that can restrict included chromosomes, genomic regions, transcript_ids, gene_types or transcripts with certain 'tag' values (as used in gencode).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The transcriptome build process is configured by a single JSON file/dict as shown below. The transcriptome object keeps track of the numbers of filtered GFF entries in a `log` Counter object that is, e.g., useful for debugging. The 'structure' of the parsed features can be accessed via the `get_struct()` method.\n",

In this regard, their functionality overlaps partially with pygenlib's genomic iterators that are mainly built on the [pysam](https://pysam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) implementation.\n",

    "While using these libraries on large datasets is often considerably faster than the corresponding 'native' pygenlib iterators, it is also a bit 'unsafer' to use them as [demonstrated below](#) as ...\n",
    "\n",
    "After highlighting such potential pitfalls, we show some [performance comparisons](#Performance-comparison) for various scenarios and show that speed benefits are often anulled when considering only subsets of large datasets (such as features of certain types on certain chromosomes) as the compared libraries either load the whole dataset before filtering can be applied (e.g., bioframe) or need to apply relatively costly preprocessing operations (such as pybedtools intersect) that are efficiently solved by pygenlib's pysam-based iterators that leverage the respective indexing structures for this purpose.\n",

    "### PyBedtools comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "[Pybedtools](https://daler.github.io/pybedtools/index.html) is a python library wrapping the popular BEDTools utilities. It enables various set theory operations on genomic dataset (such as intersect, merge, count, complement, and shuffle) in various data formats (BAM, BED, GFF/GTF and VCF) and also supports data streaming. In this regard, its functionality overlaps partially with pygenlib's genomic iterators that are mainly built on the pysam implementation. \n",
    "\n",
    "While pybedtools is considerably faster than the corresponding 'native' pygenlib iterators, it is also a bit 'unsafer' to use them as demonstrated below. Overall, however, we envision that user's would like to mix and match pybedtools and pygenlib based on the actual use-case and performance requirements. Users could, for example, use BEDtools set operations on some input file, store these files and then run a pygenlib analysis on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate seamless workflows that integrate both libraries, we also implemented a `PybedtoolsIterator` that wraps a pybedtools BedTool while providing the same interface (e.g., region filtering, stats  output) as other pygenlib iterators. Below we compare the performance of pygenlib and pybedtools iterators on various tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Iteration\n",
    "Here we compare iteration performance between a native `pybedtools` and a `pygenlib` bed iterator. On our test system, pybedtools was ~40-60% faster."

    "The following code block was copy-pasted from the [pybedtools page](https://github.com/daler/pybedtools) and the idea of this example is to create a list of gene names that are <5 kb away from intergenic SNPs. However, this code does not work properly (with pybedtools v0.9.1) due to inconsistent chromosome order of the two input files (hg19.gff: chr1, chr21; snps.bed.gz: chr21, chr1; both are pybedtools test resources).\n",

    "Only when omitting the `stream=True flag`, genes.closest() fails and reports the inconsistent chrom order. \n",

    "In this example we use pygenlib to instantiate a human Transcriptome (canonical protein-coding transcripts on chromosome 2 only), download an  CTCF motif dataset with bioframe and annotate all transcripts with those motifs. We then report all genes/transcripts with at least one overlapping CTCF motif.\n",
    "This example demonstrates how to use these two libaries together for maximum benefit.\n",

    "We show two scenarios and compare their runtimes.\n",

    "    - we instantiate a filtered pygenlib transcriptome\n",
    "    - we then annotate with the JASPAR motifs loaded via bioframe\n",
    "    - for annotation we use a custom callback method which is very flexible.\n",
    "    - finally, we build a pandas dataframe with results containing one row per tx\n",
    "- scenario2\n",
    "    - we read the GFF with bioframe and correct the start coordinate due to the issue described above\n",
    "    - we overlap tx and ctcf sites with the bioframe overlap method (NOTE that we cannot use the inner join as it would change the order of the ctcf sites)\n",
    "    - we create a results dataframe while filtering for the respective transcripts. This is done base on GFF attributes parsed from the 'attributes' column.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Scenario1 is faster (probably due to early filtering) and more flexible in our opinion. \n",
    "In the callback annotation method users have access to genomic locations and all data attributes of transcripts and the overlapping CTCF motifs as well as external data. \n",
    "They are also free to chose the created annotation data structures (here a list of location/score tuples). Together, this enables the implementation of complex annotation scenarios."
